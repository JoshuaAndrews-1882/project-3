You arrive in Kryta and are instantly under attack by the undead!
You fight them off and make your way to the capital, Lions Arch.

Upon entering Lions Arch you are greeted by the White Mantle, who are the
leaders of Kryta.
The White Mantle offer you a settlement in the north of Kryta if you help them
fight the undead!
