You arrive at a Dwarven camp where you are greeted and treated well by the
Deldrimor Dwarves.
They tell you their struggles in their fight against the Stone Summit, how they will
kill whoever tries to pass through the Shiverpeak Mountains!

They tell you of Deldrimore Dwarves that have been captured and imprisoned by
the Stone Summit.
They ask for you to join the Deldrimor Dwarves and help free the captured and in
return they will help you cross to Kryta.
But can they be trusted...
