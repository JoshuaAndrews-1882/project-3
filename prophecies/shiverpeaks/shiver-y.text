You agree to help the Deldrimor Dwarves and set out across the mountains to free the captured Dwarves and to get to Kryta.

You encounter many Stone Summit, and endure long and tough battles, freeing many captured Dwarvesalong the way.  The Dwarves keep their word and help you cross the mountains.

In the final pathway a loud rumbling noise is heard coming from behind, as you turn you see hundreds of Stone Summit heading towards you.
Prince Rurik shouts for you to leave and he will stay and hold them off so the people of Ascalon have a chance of survival.
Prince Rurik dies and you lead the Ascalonians to Kryta.
